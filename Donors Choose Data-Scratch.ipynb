We are in desperate need of math counters, clocks, magnetic money, cubby pencils and critical thinking materials. With the use of these products the children in special education can access learning math skills at their level, their speed, and their way. These products will not only be used in the special education resource room, but will help the students to be able to gain ownership of skills that are needed to participate in the general education classroom.

I also believe that the variety and diversity in my classroom is seen as a positive element, as students are given the opportunity to learn from students of diverse perspectives and social and cultural backgrounds.

A large classroom library would also increase engagement and literacy skills in all of my classrooms and prepare my students for college.

        "9 \"It is never too early to get children thinking about their future.  We always hear that question \"\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"\"  We are trying to help our students figure that out by starting up a journalism club. \"\n",
        "9 \"Kindergartners naturally gravitate to playing on their hands and knees, but are quickly learning to sit patiently when they hear me say, \u201cCrisscross Applesauce!\u201d From story and circle time to free reading-- they spend so much time on the floor!  They desperately need a rug. \"\n",
        "9 \"Make the library fun for everyone!  There isn't seating for our K, 1st and 2nd graders, they have to move the huge and heavy big chairs and tables we have, and often just end up sitting on the floor.  This isn't the best way to learn!! \"\n",
        "9 \"Math is one of the subjects children struggle with the most. I am trying my best to make it fun and engaging for my students, but need a little extra help! \"\n",
        "9 \"My Kindergarten students are sitting on desks that are ancient. They are old, small, heavy and hard to move. It's been a challenge having my students work together in a group with these given desks. \"\n",
        "9 \"My classroom has an Interactive Board that my students love to use and enhance their learning with. The Interactive Board helps students learn through individual, small group and whole class experiences.  The board is used throughout the whole day.  We need a laptop to run the board. \"\n",
        "9 \"My dedicated elementary drama students are facing the challenge of trying to put on major licensed productions such as our last \"\"Beauty and the Beast, Jr.\"\" but are lacking the much needed resources to help in creating these imaginary worlds, where anything can happen. \"\n",
        "9 \"My students are amazing! Six of my classroom chairs are mine from home because my overcrowded classes required students to stand up. My AP Biology students cannot perform some of the College Board mandated labs because of lack of supplies. And yet they achieve excellence every day! \"\n",
        "9 \"My students crave positive reinforcement and a greater sense of accomplishment! \"\n",
        "9 \"Our classroom is a dynamic place for students to explore, invent, and make learning their own. These scholars have been working hard to understand the rudiments of reading, and are ready to begin writing sentences, opinion pieces and stories of their own! \"\n",
        "9 \"Remember when you were in kindergarten and the teacher asked, \"\"Who would like to finger paint, play with blocks or use the house center?\"\" Things have changed! Children are now reading and  writing but they still need movement. Stability balls provide necessary movement while they work. \"\n",
        "9 \"Some of the worst memories of school involve the screeching of chalk on the chalk board. That gut-wrenching screech is etched into so many of our memories that it is detested and easily identifiable. Luckily, most students today have the option of using a new, screech free alternative: the white board. However, not all students have this option. Some students, like the inner-city 5th graders in my school, have to deal with those screeching, chalk-filled boards. This high-needs community reaches out for help and so often is found without it. In a classroom with only chalkboards messages are lost and words blend together until students are squinting to read what is on the board. With conditions like these it is no surprise that these students are 2-3 years behind in both reading and math.   \"\n",
        "9 \"Students need an Apple TV, digital multimedia receiver and all of the necessary cables and adapters to hook up our iPad to the projector, so that we can use it as a tablet and white board to explore Chemistry! \"\n",
        "9 \"Students want to say, \"\"Good-Bye\"\" to Power Points and Chart Paper!  They want to use video cams to add depth to cooperative group learning.  Students will build technological expertise integrating video, white board and computer skills while practicing critical thinking and purposeful team work. \"\n",
        "9 \"The creepiest image from Greek mythology, in my opinion, is the head of Medusa... snakes writhing about. Sadly, the wiring attaching laptops, speakers and iPads to my projector has begun to resemble Medusa's hair. I am trapped at desk during presentations instead of being with my students! \"\n",
        "9 \"This proposal is to help my students of various grade levels with Learning Disabilities and other disabilities to become enthusiastic about writing and to motivate them to create personal writing pieces.  \r",

        "\\nThe students that I teach, have learning disabilities and many are also English language learners. Most of them have difficulty writing down their ideas, or once their ideas are written in pre-written format they have difficulties with editing their writing, due to their low skills with writing cohesively, spelling and grammar.  These students get frustrated with having to re-write their work a few times and get tired of writing in order to make it better.  Their frustration levels become increased and many therefore quit, and or won't even try to begin or to have finished writing products that they can be proud of.  \r",
        "\\n\r",
        "\\nI believe that with the use of a computer and its editing,and writing programs my students will become motivated writers and authors. It would be so much easier for them to focus on expressing their ideas rather than having to write.  They will be able to use the scanner/printer to scan their own drawings and/or pictures into their writing  and to print out their work that they have worked hard to complete.\r",
        "\\n\r",
        "\\nThe use of computers will lessen their frustration levels and increase their motivation.  They will finally have finished products such as poems, songs, and even short stories (books) that they will be proud to display and share with others.  \r",

        "\\nPlease consider in helping to motivate and create young authors with disabilities that can be proud of creating and completing  writing projects.\"\n",

        "9 \"Wouldn't it be great to be able to revise and edit your written work on the computer instead of writing and rewriting on paper? \"\n",
        "9 \"Writing is an important skill for ALL students.  My students have not yet reached their  full potential in writing.  We need these supplies to help us reach that potential.  These supplies will allow my students to capture and share their imaginations. \"\n",
        "9 \"Writing is tough for some students, especially in middle school.  Students who can see good examples of their peers writing will want to write more.  A student whose writing is shown as a good example is a surefire motivator! \"\n",
